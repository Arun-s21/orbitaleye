# Orbital Eye: A 3D Satellite Tracker



Orbital Eye is an interactive, real-time 3D visualization of satellites orbiting a realistic model of Earth. Built with Next.js and Three.js, this application fetches real Two-Line Element (TLE) data to accurately calculate and display the paths of various satellites.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Real-Time Satellite Tracking:** Utilizes the `satellite.js` library to accurately propagate satellite positions from real TLE data.
* **Interactive 3D Globe:** A fully interactive 3D scene built with Three.js, featuring a textured Earth, a moving Sun, and a realistic starfield skybox.
* **Dynamic Satellite Selection:** Users can select from a list of available satellites to dynamically add or remove them from the scene.
* **Visual Orbits:** Each active satellite has its orbital path rendered as a line, making it easy to visualize its trajectory.
* **Collision Detection:** The application monitors the distance between all active satellites and displays a prominent on-screen alert if they come within a predefined threshold.
* **Realistic Day/Night Cycle:** The sun's position and lighting are animated, creating a realistic day/night cycle on the Earth's surface.
* **User Controls:**
    * **Camera:** Full orbital camera controls (zoom, pan, rotate) are enabled via `OrbitControls`.
    * **Simulation Speed:** A slider allows the user to speed up or slow down the simulation time.
